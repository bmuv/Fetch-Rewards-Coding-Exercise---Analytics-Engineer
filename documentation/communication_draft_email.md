# Data Quality Findings and Recommendations for Receipts, Users, and Brands Data

Dear [Business Leader's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to data-driven decision making, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of our receipts, users, and brands datasets. This analysis has revealed several data quality issues that may significantly impact our business insights and operations. Below, I outline key findings, propose next steps, and address important questions about our data assets.

## Executive Summary

- **Receipts Data**: Significant gaps in reward-related and transaction data
- **Users Data**: High rate of duplicate records
- **Brands Data**: Presence of test data and duplicate entries

These issues affect our ability to:
1. Optimize our reward program
2. Accurately analyze sales and promotional effectiveness
3. Provide valuable insights to brand partners
4. Understand our competitive position

## Key Findings

### 1. Receipts Data (Overall)
- 45-52% of entries missing crucial information (e.g., points earned, purchase date)
- **Impact**: Hinders analysis of reward programs, purchase patterns, and operational efficiency

### 2. Receipts Data (Item-Level)
- 87% of items missing points earned data
- 8-87% of items missing various price-related data
- 35% of items lack brand codes
- **Impact**: Limits our ability to optimize rewards, analyze promotions, and provide partner insights

### 3. Users Data
- 57% of user records are duplicates
- **Impact**: Potential for inflated user counts and inaccurate behavior reporting

### 4. Brands Data
- 31% of entries are test data
- Some `brandCode` values contain barcode data instead of actual brand codes
- **Impact**: Risk of inaccurate brand-related insights and product linking

## Questions About the Data
1. Are fields with very high missing rates (>95%) still relevant to our business processes?
2. What is the source of test data in our brands dataset, and is it necessary to retain?
3. Are there known issues with our data collection processes explaining high rates of missing data?
4. How frequently is our data updated, and are there known issues with the update process?

## Additional Information Needed
- Recent changes to data collection processes or system integrations
- Clear understanding of data flows from source systems
- Feedback from data consumers on their most critical needs
- Expected data volume growth over time

## Performance and Scaling Concerns
1. **Query Performance**: Potential for slower query times with large datasets
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Inflated storage needs due to duplicates and irrelevant data
3. **Data Consistency**: Challenges in maintaining quality across growing datasets

Proposed solutions include strategic indexing, regular data cleaning, and automated quality checks.

I'm available to discuss these findings in detail and collaborate on improving our data quality to drive better business outcomes.
